# Project Name
This project is part of my Data Analyst Portfolio.

#### -- Project Status: [Active]

## Project Intro/Objective
The purpose of this project is to provide insights for an upcoming video streaming platform. These insights will address what content to provide, the type of content most consumed, what type of content is consumed across the world and how real world events may effect how one consumes content form home. (Describe the main goals of the project and potential civic impact. Limit to a short paragraph, 3-6 Sentences)

### Methods Used
* Inferential Statistics
* Data Visualization
* 
* etc.

### Technologies
* SQL
* Excel
* Tableu

## Project Description
(Provide more detailed overview of the project.  Talk a bit about your data sources and what questions and hypothesis you are exploring. What specific data analysis/visualization and modelling work are you using to solve the problem? What blockers and challenges are you facing?  Feel free to number or bullet point things here)

I have gathered 4 XCL files from KAGGLE.COM(dataset shareing website --provide link to primary source of information data sets) regarding the mainstays in the video streaming services: Netflix, Amazon Prime+, Hulu and Disney+. These datasets include data such as ratings, dates updated to platform, length of videos, country of origin, etc.. Via EDA and Data Visualization I will answer the following questions:

*Streaming Services Questions to be answered:

* Most published genre?
* Most published type of format? (movie or tv series)
* How many tv series have multiple seasons and of what genre?
* Over time, what is the evolving dynamic of genre being published.
* average duration of movies and tv series.
* Is there a correlation between what movies or tv series are published in different countries.
* is there a correlation between directors, actors and rattings?
* Do popular holidays effect a movie or shows rating?
* Does duration of a movie or tv series have any noticable effect on ratings.
* Average rating of movies and tv series (both single iterations and then with more than one season)
* Ratio of content created per country.

Interrelated questions regarding all streaming services:

* Ratio of TV series to Movies.
* Has time affected what type (movie or tv series) of new content is provided.(Answer may be already given through previous individual work)
* Has the decisions of one servie effected the buisness choices of the other providers.
* Do certain directors/cast have their content across multiple services.
* What is the average runtime of a tv series and movie.
* How frequent is content uploaded across all platforms.
* Does uploading more frequently lead to better rated content?
* Is there a correlation between release date, rating and date added on platform?
* Average ratings of all movies and TV Series.
* Average rating of all Movies with multiple parts (if possible)
* Average rating of all Tv Series with more than one season.
* Ratio of content created per contry.
* Country ranking of content created. (seperate by movies and tv series)
* Does title length   have a positive correlation to rating?
* Do films and tv series with multiple directors rate better than single directed movies?



Overachieving Quesions:

* Does weather have an affect on a titles date added rating.
* What are all the attributes of the best rated movie and tv series. (use all the data at your disposal)
* What are all the attributes of the worst rated movie and tv series. (use all the data at your disposal)
* What are all the attributes of the most average rated movie and tv series. (use all the data at your disposal)


## Needs of this project

- frontend developers
- data exploration/descriptive statistics
- data processing/cleaning
- statistical modeling
- writeup/reporting
- etc. (be as specific as possible)

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repo (for help see this [tutorial](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/)).
2. Raw Data is being kept [here](Repo folder containing raw data) within this repo.

    *If using offline data mention that and how they may obtain the data from the froup)*
    
3. Data processing/transformation scripts are being kept [here](Repo folder containing data processing scripts/notebooks)
4. etc...

*If your project is well underway and setup is fairly complicated (ie. requires installation of many packages) create another "setup.md" file and link to it here*  

5. Follow setup [instructions](Link to file)
