## Project Intro/Objective
The purpose of this project is to provide insights for an upcoming video streaming platform. These insights will address what content to provide, the type of content most consumed, what type of content is consumed across the world and how real world events may effect how one consumes content form home. (Describe the main goals of the project and potential civic impact. Limit to a short paragraph, 3-6 Sentences)

## Project Description
(Provide more detailed overview of the project.  Talk a bit about your data sources and what questions and hypothesis you are exploring. What specific data analysis/visualization and modelling work are you using to solve the problem? What blockers and challenges are you facing?  Feel free to number or bullet point things here)

I have gathered 4 XCL files from KAGGLE.COM(dataset shareing website --provide link to primary source of information data sets) regarding the mainstays in the video streaming services: Netflix, Amazon Prime+, Hulu and Disney+. These datasets include data such as ratings, dates updated to platform, length of videos, country of origin, etc.. Via EDA and Data Visualization I will answer the following questions:

*Streaming Services Questions to be answered:

* Most published genre?
* Most published type of format? (movie or tv series)
* How many tv series have multiple seasons and of what genre?
* Over time, what is the evolving dynamic of genre being published.
* average duration of movies and tv series.
* Is there a correlation between what movies or tv series are published in different countries.
* is there a correlation between directors, actors and rattings?
* Do popular holidays effect a movie or shows rating?
* Does duration of a movie or tv series have any noticable effect on ratings.
* Average rating of movies and tv series (both single iterations and then with more than one season)
* Ratio of content created per country.

Interrelated questions regarding all streaming services:

* Ratio of TV series to Movies.
* Has time affected what type (movie or tv series) of new content is provided.(Answer may be already given through previous individual work)
* Has the decisions of one servie effected the buisness choices of the other providers.
* Do certain directors/cast have their content across multiple services.
* What is the average runtime of a tv series and movie.
* How frequent is content uploaded across all platforms.
* Does uploading more frequently lead to better rated content?
* Is there a correlation between release date, rating and date added on platform?
* Average ratings of all movies and TV Series.
* Average rating of all Movies with multiple parts (if possible)
* Average rating of all Tv Series with more than one season.
* Ratio of content created per contry.
* Country ranking of content created. (seperate by movies and tv series)
* Does title length   have a positive correlation to rating?
* Do films and tv series with multiple directors rate better than single directed movies?



Overachieving Quesions:

* Does weather have an affect on a titles date added rating.
* What are all the attributes of the best rated movie and tv series. (use all the data at your disposal)
* What are all the attributes of the worst rated movie and tv series. (use all the data at your disposal)
* What are all the attributes of the most average rated movie and tv series. (use all the data at your disposal)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1st Step: Duplicate Dataset
	Duplicating the file will prevent the original datasource from being altered beyond recovery. Also the original file will later be used to for data validation. As a second failsafe, I duplicate the original file in EXCEL and add the sufix, "_Original_File". e
2nd Step: Lock First Row and Provide Contrasting Colors
	This prevents the first row from being manipulated during sorting and formula use.
View >Freze Panes >Freeze Top Row
3rd Step: Locate Duplicate and Missing Data
Before starting a project I want to know what information is duplicated or missing from my dataset(s). This prevents miscalculated end results during the visualization phase.aff

Locating Null/empty datacells/
Via Excel I create a pivot table and search for any blanks/nulls.
Insert >PivotTable>select entire EXCEL *Select New Worksheet to create a new tab for the pivot table* >*click* OK
## --Insert image of create pivot table.

Pivot Table
With this new tab created, I am able to use the PivotTable Fields to quickly change the data presented within the pivot table. I do this by draging and dropping the column names into or by clicking the square next to each column name within the PivotTable Fields. Then drag the column name again, but this time into Values.
 
This creates a new visualization within the pivot table which has two columns. A Column named 'show_id' and 'Count of show_id' has appeared. This new chart represents how many times each individual show_id is present within our main sheet under the column by the same name. 
	This is an effective way to check for duplicate entries manually and how many NULLS are present as shown below.
 
Sorting Pivot Tables
To sort the pivot table in descending order you click the down arrow next to show_id within the pivot table as shown below.
 

Then click "Sort By Value..." and in the new pop up window you make sure you select the "Largest to Smallest" option and click ok.
 

Before Sorting:
 	
After Sorting:
 

It seems theres no duplicates within this column. 

Alternate Duplicate Removal Tool
	Alternately we could use the inhouse excel duplicate cleaning tool. This automated option is under Data >Data Tools >Remove Duplicates
 

Clicking Remove Duplicates provides us with another window with more filtering options to selectivly remove duplcates from multiple columns, the currently selected column, and to change the names of the header to the letter or your own header (whatever name is located within the first row of each column). 
Remove Duplicates popup window:
 
Show only column letters:
 
After clicking OK, a new pop up appears. This popup shows how many duplicates we removed with their respective row and how many rows are remaining. 
	As an example I removed all the duplicates in the "type" column:
 
8805 duplicates were found and deleted which leaves me with 2 rows. 
Pivot Table: Finding and Manually Cleaning Duplicates
	Searching through the rest of the columns for duplicates you would come across duplicates in the title column.
Title Column
 

We have 8 titles with duplicate appearences. DON'T PANIC! Lets go back to our Netflix_Edited_File and filter out each individual title so only they appear.

Filtering Columns
On the Netflix_Edited_File tab, you can click on the C column to highlight the entire thing and then click Data tab >Filter, then finally click the arrow that appears in cell C1:
 

 This brings up a filter pop up where we will enter the name of the title we want to have displayed. Type the title in the search field. Then click Apply to see the changes reflect onto the sheet.

 


 

Now we can see the two rows that share the same title. 
Correcting Missing Data

These two titles share the same release data, amount of seasons, and descriptions. Its aparent one of the two is missing  2 actors that the other entry has. I copied over the actors so the two entries mirror eachother. 
	There wil be duplicate entries with matching names due to reasons like, multiple seasons, canceled or returning content (after being removed and brought back to the platform, which is what we see here with this title).
	I also added an additional column to add clarity incase a team member were to find this situation. This column is called Dup_Notes.
    
Once done, return the sheet to its former apperence by clicking the drop arrow again and clicking "Clear Filter from Title
 


Pivot Table Cleaning (Continued)
Return to the pivot table to clean the rest of the columns via the same technique just used.

Assign New Show_ID
Now that we have removed all duplicates, we need to reassign new show_id's for each film. But before that, we need to make a duplicate of our Netflix_Edited_File (incase an error is made assigning new show_ids). 
 
Renamed new duplicate tab as, Netflix_Edited_New_Show_ID_File by right clicking the click Rename, or double left click on the tab to rename.
